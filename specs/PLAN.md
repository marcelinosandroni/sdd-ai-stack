# 🎯 PLAN (the brain of the project)

> 🛑 **FIXED RULE (AI agent, READ THIS BEFORE YOU CODE):**
> The developer has ADHD, time blindness, and zero patience for junk.
> The tasks HERE must be **microscopic**.
> If a task takes more than 1 hour, **SPLIT IT IN TWO**.
> Never skip a step. Never start step 2 without testing and committing step 1.
> Update statuses rigorously at the end of every prompt: `[ ]` (To Do), `[-]` (In
> Progress), `[x]` (Done).

> **There is exactly ONE task `[-]` at any moment.** If there are two, the agent stopped
> wrong.

> **The first task of a brand-new project is not a feature.** It is replacing the
> placeholders with the real product: `APP.md`, the `DESIGN.md` tokens, and the first
> vertical slice. A scaffold with `[YOUR APP NAME]` still in it is not a scaffold, it
> is a placeholder with a build script.

## Current phase: 0 — Bootstrap

> Status: 🔲 not started. This is a brand-new project: the phase history is empty
> (see `history/README.md`), because the template's own history is not yours.

### Tasks

- [ ] No tasks yet. Create the first one:
      `node SDD/SKILLS/create-task/create-task.mjs 0 1 "<what you are building>"`

### Phase exit criteria
- [ ] Every task `[x]` with the test evidence pasted
- [ ] `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` green
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e` green against the production build
- [ ] `docs/CHANGELOG.md` updated
- [ ] `specs/history/phases/phase-0-<name>.md` written
- [ ] SemVer tag created

### How to use this file

1. Create the phase block when the phase changes: `## Current phase: N — NAME`.
2. Tasks live under `### Tasks`, one per line, `[ ]` / `[-]` / `[x]`.
3. Mark `[-]` **before** starting. Mark `[x]` **after** you paste the green output.
4. When the phase closes, archive it in `history/phases/`, delete the finished task
   files, and tag the release.

## 📋 Delivery checklist (paste at the end of every task)

```markdown
**Evidence:**
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run lint` → 0 errors
- `npm run test` → N passed
- `npm run build` → ✓ Compiled successfully
- `npm run test:e2e` → N passed

**Files touched:** (list them — max 5 per step)
**Commit:** `type(scope): description. (Agent: <Tool> - <Model>)`
```
